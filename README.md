ALL IN ONE ZONE

Here,in "ALL IN ONE ZONE" instead of visiting many websites like online shopping, social media platforms and many other websites, I created a single website where we can see all websites which is related to many platforms like Entertainment,Education,Shopping.
I made a sections according to the people's choice such as:
Online shopping, Social media, Educational, Entertainment and Top sites.
This will help you in saving time and its easily accessible in one site.
Here,you can see 'home','about us' and 'feedback' option for more details.

How it works:

The script is controlled mostly from 'HTML' and 'CSS'. You specify layers in your markup and position them in CSS. You set HTML5 data attributes on each layer to let the script know about them. That is also where you specify the speed for the layer.

Source Used:

The images and website links are added from "Google"

Technologies Used:

HTML and CSS
